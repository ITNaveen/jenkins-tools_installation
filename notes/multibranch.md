- create multibranch pipeline
- choose branch source
- build config - jenkins file in source code

- we will see multibranch logs and it show jenkinsfile repo in main branch.
- from jenkins i go to this branch and see only main branch as we have only this now.
- if we add any more branches then we need to scan multibranch pipeline now.
- now i created new branch "dev" then scanned again and see dev branch as well in dashboard under this multibranch repo.
